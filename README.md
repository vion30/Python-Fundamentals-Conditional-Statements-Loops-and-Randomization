# Python Fundamentals: Conditional Statements, Loops, and Randomization

## Overview

This project is an exploration of basic Python concepts, focusing on decision-making, loops, and randomization. The code examples showcase the use of conditional statements, different looping mechanisms, and basic random number generation. These are essential concepts for building more complex programs and understanding Python's core features.

## Key Features

* Use of conditional statements (if, else, elif) for decision-making in Python.
* Implementation of various loops (for, while) and loop control statements (break, continue, pass).
* Range function: Demonstrating its use in loops and iterating over sequences.
* Random library: Introduction to generating random numbers and its applications.
* Simple Python programs illustrating real-world problem-solving using the above concepts.

## Technology Used

* Python 3.x: The core language used for writing the code.
* Jupyter Notebook: Used for coding and running examples interactively.
